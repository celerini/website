<h2 id='game'>What's New in Wesnoth 1.6</h2>

<p>We have many new features for your enjoyment this time around,
including a new mainline campaign, two new multiplayer scenarios and
another refresh of the user interface.</p>

<h3 id='players'>For Players</h3>

<h4 id='campaigns'>Campaigns</h4>

<div class='thumb tright'>
  <div><a href='images/start-2-full.jpg'><img src='images/start-2.jpg' alt='Wesnoth Screenshot'/></a></div>
</div>

<p>There is a new mainline campaign, <em>The Legend of Wesmere</em>,
with new gameplay features including (in one scenario) the ability to
use the game AI as your commander for an allied side, setting its
objectives as you like. Search for this hidden feature by 
right-clicking on your allied commanders during scenario 7.
This campaign was imported from the
<a href="http://www.wesnoth.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=21413">Wesnoth-UMC-Dev project</a>,
where it spent a few months being adapted
for mainline.</p>

<p>Almost all mainline campaigns now use a different method of carrying
over gold from scenario to scenario: the amount of gold retained is now
40% instead of 80%, but it is added to the minimum starting gold of the
next scenario instead of only replacing it if higher.</p>

<p>Many mainline campaigns have improved storyline prose and new
cutscenes or epilogs.  Several have improved and redrawn campaign
maps. All now have dates in the Wesnoth history timeline, and almost
all have journey animations on their campaign maps.  The history and
geography of Wesnoth have been developed in more depth and detail:
More campaigns now include references to events in the overall
history, adding depth and richness to the narration.</p>

<h4 id='multiplayer'>Multiplayer</h4>

<p>The multiplayer server can now be logged onto using the username and
password of a Wesnoth forum account.  However, registration is
not required and one can continue to use an
unregistered username.</p>

<div class='thumb tright'>
  <div><a href='images/start-1-full.jpg'><img src='images/start-1.jpg' alt='Wesnoth Screenshot'/></a></div>
</div>

<p>The multiplayer lobby has been improved to allow easier management of
the friends and ignores list by double-clicking on the player list.</p>

<p>Notable changes to default era balancing include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increased the cost of the Goblin Spearman from 8 to 9.</li>
<li>Increased the movement of the Goblin Spearman line from 4 to 5.</li>
<li>Increased the melee attack of the Goblin Spearman from 4-3 to 6-3.</li>
<li>Added the traits weak, slow and dim and made goblins each receive one of
them instead of two standard traits.</li>
<li>Added the marksman special to the ranged attack of the Orcish Assassin
line.</li>
<li>Increased the cost of the Walking Corpse from 7 to 8.</li>
<li>Decreased the cost of the Bowman from 15 to 14.</li>
<li>Decreased the melee attack of the Bowman from 6-2 to 4-2.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id='general'>General</h4>

<p>The game graphics have been improved with a whole new range of unit
portraits.  Many more units have full animations and team coloring.</p>

<div class='thumb tright'>
  <div><a href='images/start-4-full.jpg'><img src='images/start-4.jpg' alt='Wesnoth Screenshot'/></a></div>
</div>

<p>There is a new basic terrain type, coastal reef, which gives most
land-based units slightly higher defense than in regular shallow
water, and 70% defense to most water-based units such as mermen and
nagas.  Forests get more variety with graphics for spring/summer, fall
and winter deciduous forest terrains.  There are new village graphics
for human cities and primitive tribal areas.</p>

<p>Our composers have added five new original background tracks:
<em>Heroes' Rite</em>, <em>Siege of Laurelmor</em>, <em>Suspense</em>,
<em>The Dangerous Symphony</em> and <em>The Deep Path</em>. Also, the
game now plays special music clips for victory and defeat events.</p>

<p>The game interface has continued to evolve, especially in making
more dramatic use of portraits.  Unit recall dialogs now display useful
information about your veterans' traits.  Add-ons now display their
category when you browse them on the download server.</p>

<p>New game translations include Arabic, Croatian, Friulian, Latvian,
Macedonian and Marathi.  Existing translations have been extensively
updated and revised.</p>

<h3 id='campdev'>For Content Developers</h3>

<p>The map editor was much improved (thank you, Google Summer of
Code).  It can be started from within the game now.  You can toggle
overlay displays of terrain codes and map coordinates while
editing. The editor can handle multiple maps in a session, and you can
take screenshots of full maps.  There's also a new interactive editing
tool for animated journey tracks.</p>

<div class='thumb tright'>
  <div><a href='images/start-3-full.jpg'><img src='images/start-3.jpg' alt='Wesnoth Screenshot'/></a></div>
</div>

<p>There are some new core units available everywhere: Troll Shaman,
Royal Warrior and Dread Bat.</p>

<p>Less visible changes include improvements in the game AI, including a new
formula-based AI that allows more flexible setting of objectives and an
improved pathfinding algorithm.  As usual, WML has grown more powerful
with many new tags and attributes to extend the range of what
campaign authors can do.  The GUI engine is under heavy development; these
changes will allow the entire GUI to be configured from WML.  The first steps
have been made, but the project is not finished yet and will continue in the
1.7 development cycle.</p>

<p>The support for writing Python AIs has been removed because the
feature opened a serious security hole. However, we hope to build an even more
powerful AI-scripting feature, possibly using a different and safer
extension language, in 1.7.</p>
