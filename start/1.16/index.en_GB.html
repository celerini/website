<h2 id="game" class="center">What’s New in This Update</h2>

<h3 id="players">For Players</h3>

<div class="thumb tright"><a href="images/start-5.jpg"><img src="images/start-5-thumb.jpg" alt="Dunefolk overhaul sample screenshot" /></a></div>

<p>Players will be automatically upgraded to a new stable series for the first
time since <cite>Wesnoth</cite> was released due to our use of more modern
distribution platforms such as Steam, itch.io, Flathub, and others. To
support this, an option will be shown the first time 1.16.0 is started after
being upgraded from 1.14.17. This will provide the option to migrate
settings as well as download the 1.16 version of any add-ons that are
installed, if they have been updated to work with 1.16. To go along with
that, <cite>Wesnoth</cite> is now able to select save files from previous
versions from within the game itself.</p>

<p>Addressing a long-standing pain point, especially for players with low
download speeds and/or data limits, updating add-ons will no longer result
in the entire add-on being re-downloaded — instead only the files that have
actually changed will be downloaded, which will significantly reduce both
the time it takes to update add-ons as well as how much data is used when
updating. Additionally, any version of an add-on that has been recently
uploaded by the author can be selected for download, thus allowing for
downgrading an add-on if needed for any reason.</p>

<p>Many aspects of the AI have seen improvements as well, with much of the
experimental AI having been merged into the default AI. This allows it to
better handle healers, poison, retreating, and other behaviour.</p>

<p>Finally, the entire Dunefolk faction has been reworked and re-balanced,
including a re-imagining of the unit lines, new unit descriptions and
sprites, and reworking of the liminal alignment. They should now be much
closer to the factions in the Default era in terms of overall strength as
well as be more interesting to play.</p>

<h4 id="campaigns">Campaigns</h4>

<div class="thumb"><a href="images/start-1.jpg"><img src="images/start-1-thumb.jpg" alt="Campaigns menu screenshot" /></a></div>

<p><cite>Descent into Darkness</cite>, <cite>Liberty</cite>, and <cite>Sceptre
of Fire</cite> have received a multitude of revisions, including
streamlining of the game-play, addition of RPG elements, various story-line
and dialogue rewrites, and visual and balance updates. For those looking for
something befitting the upcoming night of Halloween, the overhauled,
undead-heavy <cite>Descent into Darkness</cite> as well as the <cite>Secrets
of the Ancients</cite> are the campaigns to play! <cite>Under the Burning
Suns</cite> also received revamped maps and the Quenoth faction was
re-balanced to better match the other mainline factions.</p>

<p>To accompany the improved AI that was added in this development cycle, all
campaigns were adjusted to retain their intended difficulties and to prevent
unusual difficulty spikes throughout the campaign, most notably in
<cite>Eastern Invasion</cite>. The novice level campaigns were also reduced
in difficulty to make them more accessible to newer players.</p>

<p><cite>The Hammer of Thursagan</cite> had several scenarios revised and
others removed to modernize the story and game-play, especially to focus
more on dwarven culture and the interactions between their
clans. <cite>Secrets of the Ancients</cite> also received a minor game-play
update with new zombie variations available for creation and recruiting.</p>

<p>Finally, accompanying the various modernization changes and adjustments to
many of the mainline campaigns, a new campaign menu was made featuring
several stunning backgrounds drawn by Emilien Rotival (LordBob), Stefan, and
Kathrin Polikeit (Kitty).</p>

<h4 id="multiplayer">Multiplayer</h4>

<div class="thumb tright"><a href="images/start-2.jpg"><img src="images/start-2-thumb.jpg" alt="Isar's Cross background" /></a></div>

<p>There have been two major additions to <cite>Wesnoth’s</cite> multiplayer
content: Isle of Mists and World Conquest. Isle of Mists is a co-op survival
scenario in the vein of Dark Forecast, the latter of which has had its
difficulty reduced with the former taking its place in terms of
challenge. World Conquest, formerly the add-on World Conquest II, is a
multiplayer campaign with RPG elements where up to three players can
co-operate to survive, upgrade their units, and defeat the armies opposing
them.</p>

<p>The add-on Plan Unit Advance is also now included in mainline. When enabled,
this allows players to pre-emptively choose what they want their units to
become if they advance on another player’s turn in multiplayer. Separately
complementing this, units whose advancement has not been planned will now
always advance into the same unit rather than choosing one at random when
there are multiple options available.</p>

<p>This update also includes a large number of balance updates to the default
era factions, especially gold and hit-points tweaks to key units. Certain
match-ups and units should now be more balanced and allow for greater
diversity in game-play.</p>

<p>Another significant change is a new feature which isolates add-on content
from each other once a game has started. This will prevent add-ons that are
not being used in a game from interfering with each other, thereby
significantly reducing the occurrence of strange bugs and out of sync
errors.</p>

<p>Improvements for game hosts to better handle unwanted players have also been
implemented — bans from individual games are now enforced by username rather
than just by IP address, people on a player’s ignore list are now
automatically banned from joining their games, and observers are now also
required to enter the password to join password protected games rather than
just players.</p>

<h4 id="creators">For Content Creators</h4>

<div class="thumb tleft"><div><a href="images/start-3.jpg"><img src="images/start-3-thumb.jpg" alt="Royal Warrior portrait"/></a></div></div>

<p>To go along with the new incremental downloads of add-on updates mentioned
above, this release also includes incremental uploads for add-on authors;
when uploading a new version of your add-on you will only send the files
that have changed rather than the entire add-on. Additionally, add-ons can
now provide translations of their titles and descriptions for multiple
languages in the <code>_server.pbl</code> file. A minor security improvement
has also been made to <code>_server.pbl</code> handling — it is no longer
required for the passphrase field to be stored plain-text in the file;
instead <cite>Wesnoth</cite> will prompt you to enter the passphrase if it
is not present.</p>

<p>More significantly, though perhaps less visible, are the various and sundry
improvements made to the WML, Lua, and Wesnoth Formula Language (WFL)
APIs. First and foremost, many of the existing Lua functions have been
re-organized into sub-modules, and a comprehensive list of these changes can
be found <a
href="https://wiki.wesnoth.org/LuaAPI/UpdatingFrom14">here</a>. While the
existing names of re-organized functions will still work, content authors
are nevertheless encouraged to update existing code to the new
modules. Separately, the version of Lua that comes packaged with
<cite>Wesnoth</cite> has been updated to 5.4 from 5.3.</p>

<p>The <code>formula=</code> attribute is now also supported in the
<code>[variable]</code> conditional tag. This allows the use of conditions
that would otherwise require the use of more complex WML or Lua, as well as
being generally a more concise way to express complex conditions.</p>

<p>The <code>male_voice=</code> and <code>female_voice=</code> attributes are
now supported in <code>[message]</code> to better allow for voice acting for
add-ons.</p>

<p>The new tag <code>[modify_unit_type]</code> has been added for campaigns,
eras, and modifications to allow for changing certain unit types’
experience, cost, and advancement options. In particular, this is meant to
be the replacement for the no longer supported <code>[advancefrom]</code>
tag.</p>

<p>Programmatically working with WML from within Lua has also been expanded and
simplified with the addition of the <code>wml.merge</code>,
<code>wml.diff</code>, <code>wml.patch</code>, <code>wml.find_child</code>,
<code>wml.attribute_count</code>, <code>wml.equal</code>,
<code>wml.valid</code>, and <code>wml.interpolate</code> functions.</p>
<div class="thumb tright"><div><a href="images/start-4.jpg"><img src="images/start-4-thumb.jpg" alt="New terrain"/></a></div></div>
<p>A great deal of new art has been added to many different areas of the
game. Portraits have been added for the Royal Warrior, Jinn, Naga Ophidian,
Naga Ringcaster, and others. New terrains such as Catacombs, Ancient Stone
floors and walls, and Overgrown Walls are now available for use in the
editor, along with many improved terrain transitions. A variety of wildlife
units have also been added, including the Crocodile, Cave Bear, Icemonax,
Fire Ant, Horned Scarab, Seahorse, and more.</p>
