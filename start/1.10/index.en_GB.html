<h1>Battle for Wesnoth 1.10 Release Notes</h1>

<h2 id='game'>What’s New in Wesnoth 1.10</h2>

<h3 id='players'>For Players</h3>

<p>Thanks to the Google Summer of Code projects from 2010 and 2011, there is a
new Whiteboard system, which helps you make plans by visualizing
recruitment, movement, attacks, and so on. It even lets you visualize plans
to share with your allies in multiplayer games.</p>

<p>Since several terrain types were added, and many more completely redrawn or
updated, including volcanoes, animated water, new embellishments, and
completely redrawn grasslands, the Wesnothian battlefield is now a much more
beautiful thing to see.</p>

<p>Many units, such as the saurians, have received new standing and other
animations. These, along with the new, animated water, help breathe life
into the previously nigh-on motionless battlefield.</p>

<p>The 1.10 series features a completely remade version of the old
<em>Northerners</em> theme as well as two new tracks: <em>Battle Epic</em>
and <em>Silvan Sanctuary</em>.</p>

<h4 id='campaigns'>Campaigns</h4>

<p>A new campaign, <em>Dead Water</em>, has been introduced; in it, you play as
a young merman who is the heir to his kingdom’s throne; your task is to
repel an undead invasion and to save your people.  <em>Dead Water</em> spent
some time being polished in the <a
href="http://wesnoth-umc-dev.sourceforge.net">Wesnoth-UMC-Dev project</a> to
prepare for mainline inclusion, just like <em>Delfador’s Memoirs</em>.</p>

<p>Most of the existing campaigns have received both major and minor updates
and improvements. For example, <em>A Tale of Two Brothers</em>’s storyline
was rewritten, and several scenarios from <em>Legend of Wesmere</em> were
reworked to include more dynamic gameplay and better mechanics.</p>

<h4 id='multiplayer'>Multiplayer</h4>

<p>Several new multiplayer maps have been introduced: <em>Æthermaw</em>,
<em>Arcanclave Citadel</em>, <em>Thousand Stings Garrison</em>, and
<em>Volcano</em>. Numerous updates and balancing tweaks were made to the
other maps &mdash; including making full use of the new terrain types.</p>

<h4 id='general'>General</h4>

</div>

<p>In addition to new portrait sets for <em>An Orcish Incursion</em>,
<em>Descent into Darkness</em>, <em>Sceptre of Fire</em>, <em>The Rise of
Wesnoth</em>, and <em>The South Guard</em>, generic portraits were added
(for example, most of the Drakes and the skeletal undead), thus getting us
closer to meeting our goal of having high-quality art throughout the whole
game.</p>

<p>The lighting system can now illuminate specific areas differently to better
show local time of day effects and, for example, keep caves dark during the
day.</p>

<p>To help you quickly identify slowed units, they are now tinted light blue.</p>

<p>Various changes were made to the UI. For example, you can now remove
multiple add-ons at once using checkboxes. Substantial improvements have
also been made in regards to typography and consistency throughout the
game. Also, the sidebar was modified to make it more appealing and easier to
read.</p>

<p>Two new translations were started: Irish and Old English.</p>

<h3 id='campdev'>For Content Developers</h3>

  <div><a href='images/start-4-full.jpg'><img src='images/start-4.jpg' alt='Wesnoth Screenshot'/></a></div>
</div>

<p>The 1.10 series brings many new features for content developers, such as <a
href="http://wiki.wesnoth.org/PersistenceWML">persistent variables</a>,
which allow add-on authors to save data to players’ user data directories
for use by other content developers or in future playthroughs.</p>

<p>The game’s Lua capabilities have been strengthened considerably, which
allows content developers to do much more than they could with it on the 1.8
series. In fact, one of our Google Summer of Code projects was focused on
improving the AI-related Lua capabilities.</p>

<p>The terrain palette has been vastly expanded with the addition of new basic
terrains as well as new structures and embellishments, thus allowing map
makers to create more vibrant maps.</p>

<p>Thanks to a Google Summer of Code project that took place during 2010 and
2011, we now have a <a href="http://eclipse.wesnoth.org">Wesnoth Eclipse
plugin</a>, which provides a full-blown IDE for WML in Eclipse thus
providing features such as syntax highlighting, tag folding,
auto-completion, and more. It even has front-ends for maintenance tools such
as <em>wmllint</em> and <em>wmlindent</em> as well as the ability to start
the game or map editor and have it go right to the desired scenario or map.</p>

<p>A new batch of item icons&mdash;drawn in the same style as the attack
icons&mdash;have been made for the benefit of content creators; depictions
of items such as potions, robes, armour, and jewellery are included.</p>

<p>Thanks to revisions in the code that handles <a
href="http://wiki.wesnoth.org/LanguageWML">[language]</a>, custom range and
attack type strings can now be translated.</p>
