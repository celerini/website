<h2 id="game" class="center">What’s New in This Update</h2>

<p>In the three-and-a-half years since version 1.12, we on the development team have dedicated much thought towards the future of Wesnoth and where we want to take the game going forward. Consequently, the version lays the groundwork for new and exciting changes, some of which are included here, and some of which we hope to unveil further down the line. Dozens of contributors dedicated hundreds of hours modernizing our engine, improving the interface, adding new content, and streamlining the player experience to ensure this version of Wesnoth is the most stable we have ever released. A huge number of long-standing bugs were squashed, a brand new solo campaign was added along with nine new multiplayer maps, and a brand new multiplayer lobby and revamped add-on manager make their debut!</p>

<p>Probably most notable of all, in order to reach a greater audience and expand our frontiers, this is also the first release to be published on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/599390"><b>Steam Store</b></a>, available for free on Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms! This is something many people have requested over the years, and we hope it brings new faces to our community.</p>

<h3 id="players">For Players</h3>

</div>

<p>As of Wesnoth 1.14, the antiquated SDL 1.2 library our engine used has been replaced with the much-improved SDL 2.0. This addresses many longstanding issues with OS and hardware compatibility. In particular, support for fullscreen on multi-monitor configurations is greatly improved and various mouse-related issues on Apple Retina devices are no more.</p>

<p>The user interface has also been further and refined and polished. The main menu now features a crisper 4K resolution background and a brand-new main theme from composer <a href="http://mattiaswestlund.net/">Mattias Westlund</a> (West). Larger and crisper fonts coupled with simplified dialog borders and buttons enhance the game’s readability across a variety of hardware and contexts, providing a more modern look. The add-ons manager, multiplayer lobby and game set-up interfaces have been completely replaced with fresh designs that we hope should address many long-standing deficiencies in all of them. The preferences dialog has also been through a substantial overhaul making it easier to navigate and use.</p>

<p>A plethora of units such as the Heavy Infantryman and the Elvish Sylph have received new animations and baseframes to bring them up to higher quality standards and make the battlefield more lively and dynamic. There are new generic portraits available for several units, including the Walking Corpse. Finally, a <i>huge</i> number of new terrains have been added to the game to enhance existing and new maps — especially indoors and underground scenarios — and water and lava have been redone in a new, smoother and fully-animated, aesthetically-pleasing style. Many village types have also received time-of-day variations and will now immersively light up when night falls.</p>

<p>Finally, the in-game sounds for many units and user interface elements have been replaced.</p>

<h4 id="campaigns">Campaigns</h4>

<p>TODO: screenshot of the Campaigns menu below</p>

<div class="center"><a href="images/start-1.png"><img src="images/start-1-thumb.jpg" alt="Title Screen" /></a></div>

<div class="thumb tleft">
  <div><a href="images/start-5.png"><img src="images/start-5-thumb.jpg" alt="Campaigns menu screenshot" /></a></div>
</div>

<p>The main campaign line-up welcomes the addition of <cite>Secrets of the Ancients</cite>, a player-created campaign brought to you by the author of <cite>Dead Water</cite>! Follow Ardonna of Tarrynth as she unearths the secrets of the Lords of the Wesfolk in her search for immortality [TODO is this actually an accurate description of the campaign].</p>

<p>After years of technical setbacks, <cite>Under the Burning Suns</cite> finally sees the desert elves faction completely revamped with brand-new sprites, stunning new portraits by long-time contributing artist <a href="https://www.theartysquid.com/">Emilien Rotival</a>, and revamped unit advancement trees with unique stats to set them apart from the standard forest elves featured throughout the rest of the game.</P>

<p><cite>Northern Rebirth</cite>'s first nine scenarios now have new and improved maps, making use of new terrains and simpler, more organic designs. The scenarios themselves have also been tweaked for more streamlined play.</p>

<p>Because of the sheer number of singleplayer campaigns included in <cite>Wesnoth</cite>, it has become increasingly difficult to get a sense of the in-universe chronology of the stories they tell. To address this, the Campaigns menu now provides the option to sort campaigns according to their position in the timeline of Irdya’s history, as well as the option to sort them alphabetically should one so desire.</p>

<p>For those who might want to enrich their gameplay with player-made gimmicks or challenges, it is now possible to use <b>Modifications</b> in singleplayer as well as multiplayer. And if the temptation to reload saves to get more favorable outcomes should overcome players, they are also able to enable a special <b>Deterministic Mode</b> when launching campaigns.</p>

<h4 id="multiplayer">Multiplayer</h4>

<p>TODO: screenshot of the MP lobby below, probably looking at 1.12</p>

<div class="center"><a href="images/start-1.png"><img src="images/start-1-thumb.jpg" alt="Multiplayer lobby screenshot" /></a></div>

<div class="thumb tright">
  <div><a href="images/start-4.png"><img src="images/start-4-thumb.jpg" alt="Wesnoth Screenshot" /></a></div>
</div>

<p>Wesnoth’s multiplayer lobby has been extensively redesigned from the ground up to provide a simpler experience for new players getting the hang of the game. With the addition of clickable links in the chat log and separate tabs for private message exchanges, easier filtering of games and players, faster game creation for those using a map author’s recommended settings, and a more comprehensive display of faction attributes.</p>

<p>In terms of content for games with other people, players will be glad to know that the game’s roster has been expanded with no fewer than nine community-contributed maps! Wesnoth now ships with a total of 55 carefully-balanced maps with many different environments and team set-ups for players to choose from.</p>

<p>The Khalifate multiplayer faction introduced in Wesnoth 1.12 has been renamed the Dunefolk. This is part of our long-term efforts to expand their lore and better ingrate them into the world of Irdya. Accompanying this are a multitude of stats changes aimed to better balance the faction in multiplayer matchups.</p>

<p>It is now possible to forfeit a multiplayer game, signaling that you no longer intend to keep playing without simply suddenly quitting.</p>

<h4 id="general">General</h4>

<div class="thumb tright">
  <div><a href="images/start-3.png"><img src="images/start-3-thumb.jpg" alt="Wesnoth Screenshot" /></a></div>
</div>

<p>It is now possible to customize the colors of the movement/attack orbs displayed alongside units on the map to make it easier for players with different color perception to identify each unit’s status. An option (disabled by default) is also provided to display a color orb on enemy units.</p>

<p>Switching to another application while Wesnoth is running now pauses the music by default. If you'd prefer it to keep playing, there is a preference for that.</p>

<p>In order to make it easier for players to include details about their system when reporting issues with the game, there is now a brand new version information dialog accessible from the bottom-left corner of the main menu. Among the information it provides are the operating system version, paths to the various files Wesnoth uses, the version numbers of the code libraries the game is built against, and a list of optional features enabled by the packager.</p>

<p>Finally, for Windows users, the game’s configuration, saves, and add-ons are now always stored in the Documents folder, in order to avoid various issues inherent to the legacy approach of writing to the system's Program Files folder, which is not recommended or well-supported in newer Windows versions. Note that while the option to use a folder in the installation path to store player files is gone, it is still possible to create a shortcut with certain command-line options to get this behavior back for those who might prefer to carry Wesnoth around on a thumb drive or the like.</p>

<h3 id="creators">For Content Creators</h3>

<div class="thumb tleft">
  <div><a href="images/start-6.png"><img src="images/start-6-thumb.jpg" alt="Wesnoth Screenshot"/></a></div>
</div>

<p>This release series brings a major and long-overdue change to the way Wesnoth content is licensed. While all content was previously required to use the GNU General Public License version 2 or later for both code and visual and sound assets, we now allow add-on creators to use any of the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/">Creative Commons licenses</A> for art, sounds, and music in their add-ons. Additionally, assets shipped with the game may be licensed under the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA license</a>. In both cases, the GNU General Public License continues to be supported and this does not retroactively affect any files previously published under the GNU GPL, unless the copyright holder chooses to dual-license said resources.</p>

<p>With regards to more technically-oriented aspects, Wesnoth’s WML, Lua, and Formula Language engines have seen a great number of improvements and changes for this release cycle. The internal Lua interpreter has been upgraded to version 5.3.4, and many new functions have been added to the <a href="https://wiki.wesnoth.org/LuaWML">Lua API</a>, as well as the ability to write <a href="https://wiki.wesnoth.org/MapGeneratorWML#The_lua_generator">map generators</a> using it, invoke certain stock dialogs used all across the game UI (menu popups, confirmation prompts, information pop-ups, the <code>[message]</code> UI, and the story screen UI), and use named Lua functions with the <code>lua_function=</code> attribute in <a href="https://wiki.wesnoth.org/StandardLocationFilter">Standard Location Filters</a>. The Gamestate Inspector now also provides access to a built-in Lua console for debugging and testing code from within the game.</p>

<p>Inline formulas in the Wesnoth Formula Language have been enhanced with the addition of many new built-in functions and syntax features. By extending support for the <code>formula=</code> filter attribute to <a href="https://wiki.wesnoth.org/StandardLocationFilter">Standard Location Filters</a> and <a href="https://wiki.wesnoth.org/StandardSideFilter">Standard Side Filters</a>, inline formulas can now be used to build more intricate logic in WML. The new <code>~ADJUST_ALPHA()</code> and <code>~CHAN()</code> <a href="https://wiki.wesnoth.org/ImagePathFunctionWML">image path functions</a> also include support for formulas to alter the rendering of images within the game.</p>

<p>The WML preprocessor now supports optional parameters with default values in macro definitions and substitution, by means of the new <a href="https://wiki.wesnoth.org/PreprocessorRef#.23arg_and_.23endarg"><code>#arg/#endarg</code> directives</a>. This should enable authors to reduce code bloat in situations where otherwise more than one definition of a macro would be needed to cover varied use cases.</p>

<p>WML’s looping constructs are more natural and flexible now with the addition of <a href="https://wiki.wesnoth.org/ConditionalActionsWML#.5Bfor.5D"><code>[for]</code> and <code>{foreach]</code></a> blocks, making the underlying syntax more lightweight compared to the old <code>{FOREACH}</code> macro and hand-written alternatives.</p>

<p>[TODO mattsc can probably tell us about "Many expansions and some simplifications to the specification of AI parameter in WML and the Lua AI API"]</p>

<p>As previously mentioned, <a href="https://wiki.wesnoth.org/ModificationWML">game modifications</a> can now be used in singleplayer campaigns as well as multiplayer. Their syntax also sees the addition of a <code>[resource]</code> tag to implement hidden modifications that can be explicitly requested by add-ons instead of manually selected by players.</p>

<p>The editor’s Open and Save As dialogs have been completely rewritten, enabling easier access to the game’s files and installed add-ons, as well as any other locations that can be saved for quick access as bookmarks.</p>

<p>Finally, content creators running the game on Windows might find it useful to create a custom shortcut for it including the new <code>--wconsole</code> command-line option, which enables a real-time display of log messages in a standard Windows console instead of writing them to a file. If keeping persistent logs as usual is preferred, we have also improved the way those are stored on disk by writing them to the <code>logs</code> folder in the player files path, and keeping the logs from up to eight past sessions stored in separate files with timestamps for convenient reference. Finally, access to the current session’s log is possible from the previously mentioned version information dialog.</p>
