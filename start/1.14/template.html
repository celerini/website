<h2 id="game" class="center">What’s New in This Update</h2>

<p>Since version 1.12, the development team has worked hard on modernizing many aspects of the game engine and user interface, allowing the game to run smoothly on modern operating systems and hardware, and laying the groundwork for even more significant changes in future stable series. But this brand-new release does not just deliver technical updates — there is a lot of new and refined content in the main game, including a new player-developed campaign, nine new multiplayer maps, and more.</p>

<p>And in order to reach a greater audience and expand our frontiers, this is also the first release to be published on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/599390"><b>Steam Store</b></a>, available for free on Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms. It is our hope that this will [TODO SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF IMPROVE WESNOTH]</p>

</div>

<p>This new version of Wesnoth sees the SDL 2.0 library replace the antiquated version 1.2, addressing many longstanding issues with OS and hardware compatibility in certain configurations. In particular, support for fullscreen on multi-monitor configurations is greatly improved and mouse support works correctly on Apple Retina devices.</p>

<p>The user interface has been greatly revised, starting from the title screen, which now features a crisper high-resolution background and a brand-new main theme from Mattias Westlund (West). Larger and crisper fonts coupled with simplified dialog borders and buttons enhance the game’s readability across a variety of hardware and contexts, providing a more modern look. The add-ons manager, multiplayer lobby and game set-up interfaces have been completely replaced with fresh designs that we hope should address many long-standing deficiences in all of them. The preferences dialog has also been through a substantial overhaul making it easier to navigate and use.</p>

<p>A plethora of units [TODO] in the Default era and in single-player campaigns have received new animations and baseframes to bring them up to higher quality standards and make the battlefield more lively and dynamic. There are new generic portraits available for several units [TODO]. Finally, a <i>huge</i> number of new terrains have been added to the game to enhance existing and new maps — especially indoors and underground scenarios — and water has been redone in a new, smoother and aesthetically-pleasing style with full animations. Many village types have also received time-of-day variations for displaying activity from their inhabitants at night.</p>

<p>Finally, the in-game sounds for many units and user interface elements have been revamped [TODO].</p>

<h4 id="campaigns">Campaigns</h4>

<p>TODO: screenshot of the Campaigns menu below</p>

<div class="center"><a href="images/start-1.png"><img src="images/start-1-thumb.jpg" alt="Title Screen" /></a></div>

<div class="thumb tleft">
  <div><a href="images/start-5.png"><img src="images/start-5-thumb.jpg" alt="Campaigns menu screenshot" /></a></div>
</div>

<p>The main campaign line-up welcomes the addition of <cite>Secrets of the Ancients</cite>, a player-created campaign brought to you by the author of <cite>Dead Water</cite>. Follow Ardonna of Tarrynth as she unearths the secrets of the Lords of the Wesfolk in her search for the immortality [TODO is this actually an accurate description of the campaign].</p>

<p>After years of technical setbacks, <cite>Under the Burning Suns</cite> finally sees the desert elves faction completely revamped with brand-new sprites, portraits, and unit advancement trees with unique stats to set them further apart from the standard forest elves featured throughout the rest of the game.</P>

<p><cite>Norther Rebirth</cite> is the first mainline campaign to be enriched with the new map terrains added in this release, for its first nine scenarios. [TODO bad phrasing]</p>

<p>Because of the sheer number of singleplayer campaigns included in <cite>Wesnoth</cite>, it becomes increasingly difficult to get a sense of the in-universe chronology of the stories they tell. To address this, the Campaigns menu now provides the option to sort campaigns according to their position in the timeline of Irdya’s history, as well as the option to sort them alphabetically should one so desire.</p>

<p>For those who might want to enrich their gameplay with player-made modifications adding new gimmicks or challenges [TODO], it is now possible to use <b>Modifications</b> in singleplayer as well as multiplayer. And if the temptation to reload saves to get more favorable outcomes should overcome players, they are also able to enable a special <b>deterministic mode</b> when launching campaigns.</p>

<h4 id="multiplayer">Multiplayer</h4>

<p>TODO: screenshot of the MP lobby below, probably looking at 1.12</p>

<div class="center"><a href="images/start-1.png"><img src="images/start-1-thumb.jpg" alt="Multiplayer lobby screenshot" /></a></div>

<div class="thumb tright">
  <div><a href="images/start-4.png"><img src="images/start-4-thumb.jpg" alt="Wesnoth Screenshot" /></a></div>
</div>

<p>Wesnoth’s multiplayer lobby has been extensively redesigned from the ground up to provide a simpler experience for new players getting the hang of the game. With the addition of clickable links in the chat log and separate tabs for private message exchanges, easier filter of games and players, faster game creation for those who are used to using the map author’s recommended settings, and a more comprehensive display of faction attributes.</p>

<p>In terms of content for games with other people, players will be glad to know that the game’s roster has been expanded with no less than nine community-contributed maps, totaling 55 carefully-balanced maps with many different environments and team set-ups for players to choose from.</p>

<p>The Khalifate faction has been renamed to Dunefolk [TODO]</p>

<p>It is now possible to forfeit a game, signaling your opponents that you will not continue playing the game [TODO]</p>

<h4 id="general">General</h4>

<div class="thumb tright">
  <div><a href="images/start-3.png"><img src="images/start-3-thumb.jpg" alt="Wesnoth Screenshot" /></a></div>
</div>

<p>It is now possible to customize the colors of the movement/attack orbs displayed alongside units on the map to make it easier for players with different color perception to identify each unit’s status. An option (disabled by default) is also provided to display a color orb on enemy units.</p>

<p>[TODO music off on focus which is optional and enabled by default]</p>

<p>In order to make it easier for players to include details about their system when reporting issues with the game, there is now a brand new version information dialog accessible from the bottom-left corner of the main menu. Among the information it provides are the operating system version, paths to the various files Wesnoth uses, the version numbers of the code libraries the game is built against, and a list of optional features enabled by the packager.</p>

<p>Finally, for Windows users, the game’s configuration, saves, and add-ons are now always stored in the Documents folder, in order to avoid various issues inherent to the legacy approach of writing to the system's Program Files folder, which is not recommended or well-supported in newer Windows versions. Note that while the option to use a folder in the installation path to store player files is gone, it is still possible to create a shortcut with certain command-line options to get this behavior back for those who might prefer to carry Wesnoth around on a thumb drive or the like.</p>

</div>

<p>This release series brings a major and long-overdue change to the way Wesnoth content is licensed. While all content was previously required to use the GNU General Public License version 2 or later for both code and visual and sound assets, we now allow add-on creators to use any of the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/">Creative Commons licenses</A> for art, sounds, and music in their add-ons. Additionally, assets shipped with the game may be licensed under the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA license</a>. In both cases, the GNU General Public License continues to be supported and this does not retroactively affect any files previously published under the GNU GPL, unless the copyright holder chooses to dual-license said resources.</p>

<p>With regards to more technically-oriented aspects, Wesnoth’s WML, Lua, and Formula Language engines have seen a great number of improvements and changes for this release cycle. The internal Lua interpreter has been upgraded to version 5.3.4, and many new functions have been added to the <a href="https://wiki.wesnoth.org/LuaWML">Lua API</a>, as well as the ability to write <a href="https://wiki.wesnoth.org/MapGeneratorWML#The_lua_generator">map generators</a> using it, invoke certain stock dialogs used all across the game UI (menu popups, confirmation prompts, information pop-ups, the <code>[message]</code> UI, and the story screen UI), and use named Lua functions with the <code>lua_function=</code> attribute in <a href="https://wiki.wesnoth.org/StandardLocationFilter">Standard Location Filters</a>. The Gamestate Inspector now also provides access to a built-in Lua console for debugging and testing code from within the game.</p>

<p>Inline formulas in the Wesnoth Formula Language have been enhanced with the addition of many new built-in functions and syntax features. By extending support for the <code>formula=</code> filter attribute to <a href="https://wiki.wesnoth.org/StandardLocationFilter">Standard Location Filters</a> and <a href="https://wiki.wesnoth.org/StandardSideFilter">Standard Side Filters</a>, inline formulas can now be used to build more intricate logic in WML. The new <code>~ADJUST_ALPHA()</code> and <code>~CHAN()</code> <a href="https://wiki.wesnoth.org/ImagePathFunctionWML">image path functions</a> also include support for formulas to alter the rendering of images within the game.</p>

<p>The WML preprocessor now supports optional parameters with default values in macro definitions and substitution, by means of the new <a href="https://wiki.wesnoth.org/PreprocessorRef#.23arg_and_.23endarg"><code>#arg/#endarg</code> directives</a>. This should enable authors to reduce code bloat in situations where otherwise more than one definition of a macro would be needed to cover varied use cases.</p>

<p>WML’s looping constructs are more natural and flexible now with the addition of <a href="https://wiki.wesnoth.org/ConditionalActionsWML#.5Bfor.5D"><code>[for]</code> and <code>{foreach]</code></a> blocks, making the underlying syntax more lightweight compared to the old <code>{FOREACH}</code> macro and hand-written alternatives.</p>

<p>[TODO celmin can probably tell us about "Several built-in predefined dialogs are now exposed to Lua, including the storyscreen"]</P>

<p>[TODO mattsc can probably tell us about "Many expansions and some simplifications to the specification of AI parameter in WML and the Lua AI API"]</p>

<p>As previously mentioned, <a href="https://wiki.wesnoth.org/ModificationWML">game modifications</a> can now be used in singleplayer campaigns as well as multiplayer. Their syntax also sees the addition of a <code>[resource]</code> tag to implement hidden modifications that can be explicitly requested by add-ons instead of manually selected by players.</p>

<p>The editor’s Open and Save As dialogs have been completely rewritten, enabling easier access to the game’s files and installed add-ons, as well as any other locations that can be saved for quick access as bookmarks.</p>

<p>Finally, content creators running the game on Windows might find it useful to create a custom shortcut for it including the new <code>--wconsole</code> command-line option, which enables a real-time display of log messages in a standard Windows console instead of writing them to a file. If keeping persistent logs as usual is preferred, we have also improved the way those are stored on disk, by writing them to the <code>logs</code> folder in the player files path, and keeping the logs from up to eight past sessions stored in separate files with timestamps for convenient reference. Finally, access to the current session’s log is possible from the previously mentioned version information dialog.</p>
